## Types of Transmission media

> In computer networking, transmission media are pathways for data transmission. They are broadly classified into guided and unguided media. Guided media uses physical cables or wires to transmit signals (e.g., twisted pair, coaxial, fiber optic), while unguided media relies on wireless transmission, such as radio waves or microwaves.

-   **Guided Media:** -

    -   **Twisted Pair Cable:**  
        Consists of pairs of wires twisted together to reduce interference. Suitable for short to medium-distance connections, common in Ethernet and telephone networks.
    -   **Coaxial Cable:**  
        Features a central conductor surrounded by an insulator and a shield, offering higher bandwidth and resistance to interference than twisted pair.
    -   **Fiber Optic Cable:**  
        Transmits data as light pulses through thin glass or plastic fibers. Offers high bandwidth, long distances, and immunity to electromagnetic interference.

-   **Unguided Media:** -

    -   **Radio Waves:**  
        Used for wireless communication like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile networks. They can be broadcast and travel through air, walls, and other obstacles.
    -   **Microwaves:**  
        High-frequency radio waves used for point-to-point communication and satellite links. Require a line of sight, making them less suitable for dense urban environments.
    -   **Infrared:**

### SWITCH

> In a computer network, a switch is a device that connects multiple devices together within a local area network (LAN). It enables these devices to communicate by forwarding data packets between them. Essentially, a switch acts as a traffic cop for data, directing it to the intended recipient rather than broadcasting it to all connected devices, as a hub would do.

Key functions of a network switch:

-   **Connecting Devices:**  
    Switches connect computers, printers, servers, and other network devices.
-   **Data Forwarding:**  
    They read the destination MAC address of data packets and forward them only to the appropriate device, not all connected devices.
-   **Network Segmentation:**  
    Switches can segment networks into smaller subnetworks or LAN segments, improving performance and security.
-   **Improved Performance:**  
    By only sending data to the intended recipient, switches reduce network congestion and improve overall performance compared to hubs.
-   **MAC Address Learning:**  
    Switches learn the MAC addresses of connected devices and store them in a table, which allows them to efficiently forward data.
-   **Operating at Layer 2:**  
    Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, making decisions based on MAC addresses.
-   **Network Management:**  
    Many switches have network management and software capabilities, allowing for configuration and monitoring.

---

#### SWITCH VS ROUTER

> A router connects different networks (e.g., a home network and the internet), while a switch connects devices within a single network. Routers operate at the network layer, making routing decisions based on IP addresses, while switches operate at the data link layer, using MAC addresses for forwarding traffic.

**Here's a more detailed breakdown:**

-   **Router:**

    -   Connects multiple networks, like your home network, a corporate network, or the internet.
    -   Determines the best path for data packets to travel between these networks.
    -   Works at the network layer (Layer 3 of the OSI model) and uses IP addresses to route data.
    -   Can perform Network Address Translation (NAT), allowing multiple devices on a network to share a single public IP address.

-   **Switch:**
    -   Connects devices within a single network, such as computers, printers, and servers.
    -   Forwards data packets to the correct destination within the network.
    -   Works at the data link layer (Layer 2 of the OSI model) and uses MAC addresses to forward traffic.
    -   Typically found in Local Area Networks (LANs).

**In essence:**

-   Routers are for connecting networks, while switches are for connecting devices within a network.
-   Routers make routing decisions based on IP addresses, while switches make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses.
-   Routers typically operate at the network layer (Layer 3), while switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2).

#### MAC ADDRESS (for context)

> A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) by the manufacturer. It acts as a device's "physical address" on a local network, similar to how an IP address is a logical address. MAC addresses are crucial for identifying devices on the network and ensuring data packets reach the correct destination.

**Here's a more detailed breakdown:**

-   **Unique Identifier:**  
    Each device with a network interface has a unique MAC address, ensuring that no two devices on the same network segment have the same address.
-   **Data Link Layer:**  
    MAC addresses are used at the data link layer of the OSI model, where they are embedded in the header of data frames to facilitate node-to-node communication.
-   **Hardware Address:**  
    MAC addresses are essentially the hardware identifiers of network devices, unlike IP addresses, which can be dynamically assigned.
-   **Format:**  
    MAC addresses are typically represented as 12 hexadecimal digits, often grouped into six pairs separated by colons (e.g., 00:1A:3F:4F:5F:70).
-   **Use in Networking:**  
    MAC addresses are used by routers and switches to forward data packets within a local network, enabling devices to communicate with each other.
-   **Manufacturer Assigned:**  
    The first part of the MAC address (usually the first three octets) is assigned by the manufacturer of the NIC, while the second part is a unique identifier for that specific device.
-   **Importance:**  
    MAC addresses are fundamental for network communication, allowing devices to be identified and addressed correctly within their local network segment.

### GATEWAY

> A network gateway is a device or software that connects two or more different networks, allowing data to flow between them. It acts as a bridge, enabling communication and data transfer even when networks use different protocols. In simpler terms, it's the "gate" that allows your local network to connect to the internet, or one local network to connect to another.

**Here's a more detailed explanation:**

-   **Connecting Different Networks:**  
    Gateways are crucial for connecting networks with different architectures, protocols, or security standards.
-   **Protocol Conversion:**  
    They often involve converting data from one protocol to another to ensure compatibility between networks.

**Examples:**

-   **Home Network:**  
    Your home network's gateway is typically your modem or modem-router combo, which connects to your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
-   **Enterprise Networks:**  
    In a large enterprise, gateways may connect the company's internal network to the internet or to other external networks.

-   **Key Function:**  
    Gateways ensure that data can be successfully transmitted between different networks, even if they use different communication methods.

---

### ROUTER vs GATEWAY

A router forwards data packets between networks, primarily based on IP addresses, while a gateway serves as a connection point between different networks or systems, often translating between different protocols. In simpler terms, a router directs data within a network, while a gateway bridges the gap between networks with potentially different communication methods.

**Here's a more detailed breakdown:**

**Router:**

-   Function: Routers manage and forward data packets between networks, making routing decisions based on destination IP addresses.
